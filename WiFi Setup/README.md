## WiFi capabiliites with ESP32
Unlike Arduino, ESP32 come with some cool features like WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities which I would be exploring. 
Looking at today's world of IoT, it is without a doubt that this microcontroller can have a role to play in wireless connectivity for efficient data transfer in some levels. 
  In this folder, I would explore the various modes in which we can setup our ESP32 to act as station, an access point or a hybrid (station mode and access point mode).
