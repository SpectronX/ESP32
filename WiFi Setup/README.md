## WiFi Capabilites with ESP32
Unlike Arduino, ESP32 come with some cool features like WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities which I would be exploring. 
Looking at today's world of IoT, it is without a doubt that this microcontroller can have a role to play in wireless connectivity for efficient data transfer in some levels. 

Here, I would explore the various modes in which we can setup our ESP32: as a station, an access point or a hybrid (station mode and access point mode).

## Setting up as a STATION
In this mode, we are basically making the ESP32 behave like our phones when they connect to a WiFi Network. In this case, there's already an active network, and we're setting the ESP32 in "listening" mode to detect and connect to it: as long as we know the password or no password at all(like in this case üòÑ). In using VS Code, Wokwi provides a sandboxed wireless access point one can use in running their simulations with ssid = "Wokwi-GUEST" and password = "" (no password)

‚ö†Ô∏è Just a note: Always be cautious about which networks you connect to‚Äîespecially open ones. Staying safe is always best.

The code for this kind of setup is provided in [file](Station.ino)
