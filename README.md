## The Swtich
After exploring the basics of Arduino for some time, I moved to using the ESP32 microcontroller and try out other stuff.
Armed with Wifi and Bluetooth capabilities, the ESP32 micrcontroller offers a plethora of functionalities which I would explore in this repo.

## Change in Platform
In the Arduino repository, Tinkercad was used for the various simulations. The limitation of the platform was the unavailability of the ESP32 microcontroller and other sensors/components. For this reason, I hopped onto the [Wokwi platform](https://wokwi.com), which supports ESP32 simulation. 

## Using Wokwi
To escape the hurdle of using the provided web-based compiler, especially when codes become larger and being on a free plan, there's an opportuniity to use VS Code for our projects: efficient for larger codes and relatively larger compile time.
