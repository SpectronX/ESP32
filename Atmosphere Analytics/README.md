## Weather Monitoring Station

In this project, I would be combining an ESP32, an LCD, and a DHT22 sensor to get readings for relative humidity and temperature of the environment. The webserver functionality of the ESP32 would be employed here to get information obtained from the sensor, displayed on a webpage.
