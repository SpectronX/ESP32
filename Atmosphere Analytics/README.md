## Weather Monitoring Station

In this project, I would be combining an ESP32, an LCD, and a DHT22 sensor to get readings for the relative humidity and temperature readings of the environment. The webserver functionality of the ESP32 would be employed here to display the obtained information on a webpage. A little note, this was done using the Wokwi simulation platform in VS code.
